The environmental impact of automobiles is an important topic today, especially due to carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, which contribute to climate change. These emissions depend on several factors, such as fuel consumption, engine size, and the number of cylinders in the vehicle.

In this study, we will use the FuelConsumption.csv dataset, which contains information on the fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions of new vehicles in Canada in 2014. Our goal is to build a simple linear regression model to predict CO₂ emissions using a single variable from the dataset.

To do this, we will follow these steps:

1. Data Exploration.
2. Predictor Variable Selection and Simple Linear Regression.
3. Multiple Linear Regression.
4. Comparison between models and Conclusion.


This study will help us better understand what factors influence CO₂ emissions and how they can be more efficiently predicted.
